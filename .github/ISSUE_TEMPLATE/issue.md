<!-- Before you open a new issue, search through the existing issues to see if others have had the same problem.

If you have a simple question or you are not sure this is an issue, don't open an issue but open a new discussion [here](https://github.com/jmcollin78/versatile_thermostat/discussions).

Check also in the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) paragrah of the README if the aswer is not already given.

Issues not containing the minimum requirements will be closed:

- Issues without a description (using the header is not good enough) will be closed.
- Issues that don't follow this template could be closed

## Version of the custom_component
<!-- If you are not using the newest version, download and try that before opening an issue
If you are unsure about the version check the manifest.json file.
-->

## Configuration

<!-- Copy / paste the attributes of the VTherm here. You can go to Development Tool / States, find and select your VTherm and the copy/paste the attributes. Surround these attributes by a yaml formatting ```yaml <put the attributes> .... ```
Without these attribute support is impossible due to the number of configuration attributes the VTherm have (more than 60). -->

## If it is releveant to regulation performance or optimisation some curves are needed
To have a great curves demonstrating what you think is a problem, please install and configure what is described here: [Even better with Plotly to tune your Thermostat](#even-better-with-plotly-to-tune-your-thermostat)

## Describe the bug
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

I'm trying to:
<!-- compleete the description -->

And I expect:
<!-- complete the expectations -->

But I observe this ....
<!-- complete what you observe and why you think it is erroneous. -->

I read the documentation on the README.md file and I don't find any relevant information about this issue.


## Debug log

<!-- To enable debug logs check this https://www.home-assistant.io/components/logger/
Add the following configuration into your `configuration.yaml` (or `logger.yaml` if you have one) to enable logs:  -->

```yaml
logger:
    default: info
    logs:
        custom_components.versatile_thermostat: info
```

<!-- You can also switch to debug mode but be careful, in debug mode, the logs are verbose.
Please copy/paste the releveant logs (around the failure) below: -->
