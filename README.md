> ![Tip](images/tips.png) This thermostat integration aims to greatly simplify your heating management automations. Since all typical heating events (nobody home?, activity detected in a room?, window open?, power load shedding?), are natively managed by the thermostat, you don‚Äôt need to deal with complicated scripts and automations to manage your thermostats. ;-).

This custom component for Home Assistant is an upgrade and a complete rewrite of the "Awesome thermostat" component (see [Github](https://github.com/dadge/awesome_thermostat)) with added features.

# What's New?
![New](images/new-icon.png)
> * **Release 7.4**:
>
> - Added thresholds to enable or disable the TPI algorithm when the temperature exceeds the setpoint. This prevents the heater from turning on/off for short periods. Ideal for wood stoves that take a long time to heat up. See [TPI](documentation/en/algorithms.md#the-tpi-algorithm),
>
> - Added a sleep mode for VTherms of type `over_climate` with regulation by direct valve control. This mode allows you to set the thermostat to off mode but with the valve 100% open. It is useful for long periods without heating if the boiler circulates water from time to time. Note: you must update the VTHerm UI Card to view this new mode. See [VTherm UI Card](documentation/en/additions.md#versatile-thermostat-ui-card).
>
> * **Release 7.2**:
>
> - Native support for devices controlled via a `select` (or `input_select`) or `climate` entity for _VTherm_ of type `over_switch`. This update makes the creation of virtual switches obsolete for integrating Nodon, Heaty, eCosy, etc. More information [here](documentation/en/over-switch.md#command-customization).
>
> - Documentation links: Version 7.2 introduces experimental links to the documentation from the configuration pages. The link is accessible via the icon [![?](https://img.icons8.com/color/18/help.png)](https://github.com/jmcollin78/versatile_thermostat/blob/main/documentation/en/over-switch.md#configuration). This feature is currently tested on some configuration pages.

# üçª Thanks for the beers üçª
[!["Buy Me A Coffee"](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/assets/img/custom_images/orange_img.png)](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/jmcollin78)

A big thank you to all my beer sponsors for their donations and encouragements. It means a lot to me and motivates me to keep going! If this integration has saved you money, buy me a beer in return; I would greatly appreciate it!

# Glossary

  `VTherm`: Versatile Thermostat as referred to in this document

  `TRV`: Thermostatic Radiator Valve equipped with a valve. The valve opens or closes to allow hot water to pass.

  `AC`: Air Conditioning. An AC device cools instead of heats. Temperatures are reversed: Eco is warmer than Comfort, which is warmer than Boost. The algorithms take this information into account.

  `EMA`: Exponential Moving Average. Used to smooth sensor temperature measurements. It represents a moving average of the room's temperature and is used to calculate the slope of the temperature curve, which would be too unstable on the raw data.

  `slope`: The slope of the temperature curve, measured in ¬∞ (C or K)/h. It is positive when the temperature increases and negative when it decreases. This slope is calculated based on the `EMA`.

  `PAC`: Heat pump

  `HA`: Home Assistant

  `underlying`: the device controlled by `VTherm`
